## Image Compare API
This is an image compare api done as an assignment for SRE. The image compare API uses absolute path names of two images in the form of csv to compare the files. The output is in the form of results csv containing the similarity score and time elapsed to do the comparison.

### Solution Design

The solution is designed to work as a web page working with almost all OS with a browser. The index page consists of a place holder to upload the csv file. Processing the csv file happens with the same API. Once the processing is done and the scores are updated, the link to download the csv is updated on the results page.
